title: This blog tech
---

Hello.

I just wanted to throw some info out there about how this blog is made. 
It is made with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and serve directly from [Github](https://github.com) via [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/).
Essentially, Github automatically consider the branch gh-pages on every repository as a jekyll project and serve it under the url http://username.github.io/repository. 

The pages themselves can be written in multiple different languages. Currently, I am using markdown.

I've used the theme [the plain](http://heiswayi.github.io/the-plain.html) as a base. 

The beautiful placeholder at the top is taken from [adorable.io](http://avatars.adorable.io/).
